# Pulsatile Flow Simulation

## Introduction

This project simulates the pulsatile flow within a cylindrical vessel, such as blood flow in arteries, using Python. 
Pulsatile flow, characterized by oscillations or pulsations in velocity, is essential for understanding various biological and engineering applications. 
The simulation leverages the concept of Womersley's number to understand how th evelocity profile varies with time.

## Features

- Simulation of velocity profiles for different Womersley numbers over one cycle of oscillation.
- Utilization of Bessel functions to accurately model the flow characteristics.
- Visualization of how velocity profiles change over time.
## Requirements

- Python 3
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- tqdm
